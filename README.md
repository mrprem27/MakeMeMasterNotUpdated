# Problem Statement Description
●"Learning never ends, but what ends learning?" There are many barriers to 
learning a skill/knowledge such as affordability, remote factors, resource 
retention, good teacher, accessibility and many more.

●And for instructor/teacher there are constraints like requirement of 
room/space , infrastructure and furniture, electricity, water, maintenance, access 
to the learners (inability to receive students/learners in rural areas).


# Approach
Complete All-in-one solution consolidated a platform that will allow sharing of resources, 
opportunities and a mechanism to interact with instructor/teacher, learners 
and peers.

## Solutions
●On this platform, instructors/teachers can create courses, create multiple classes for each course, 
assign and manage tasks, share resources, take live classes, share recorded lectures, and more. and 
manage all these with user friendly UI. 

● Learner get these following benefits:
</br>❖Live video and audio interaction with tutor/instructor (via live classes and chat)
</br>❖Tasks to analyze the performance of the learner.
</br>❖Lifelong access to all materials, resources and recorded lectures provided by the tutor/instructor.
</br>❖Can interact with like-minded peers and tutor/instructor.(via chat server)

●Learners can buy courses of his/her choice by looking at the reviews and ratings of course given by 
the previous learners without worrying about any problems and hindrances.

●A good recommendation system to reach out to the teachers/trainers that are most related to the 
interest of the learner.

● Abuse or fraud report feature for the credibility of the platform
